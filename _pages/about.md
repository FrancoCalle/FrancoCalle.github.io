I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Also I'm an affiliate researcher [ConsiliumBots](https://www.consiliumbots.com/) where I design recomendation systems using AI and economic theory.
My main research interest lay in the intersection between empirical Industrial Organization, Development and Artificial Inteligence.
