## Screening and Recruiting Talent At Teachers Colleges

<sub>With Christopher Neilson and Sebastian Gallegos</sub>

Abstract : In this paper, we study policies that use pre-college academic achievement to restrict or incentivize entry to teacher-colleges. We then study the effectiveness of two policies that used pre-college achievement to recruit or screen out students entering teacher-colleges. Using a regression discontinuity design based on the government's recruitment efforts, we evaluate the effectiveness of targeted scholarships at shifting career choices of high achieving students as well as the effect on the overall stock of teachers predicted effectiveness. We then study the effects of a recent screening policy that forces teacher colleges to exclude below-average students. We retroactively simulate this policy rule and evaluate its success at screening out low performing teachers. We compare this benchmark policy rule to a series of potential data-driven policy rules and we find that even simple screening policies can identify a significant portion of ex-post low performing teachers. In both policies studied, screening low performing students is more effective than targeting recruitment efforts to only very high achieving students. These findings suggest that the combination of better data and flexible prediction methods can be used to implement practical screening policies in some contexts.
